          Current discourse around innovation has aroused global interest on the part of corporations, governments, and
          non-profit organizations in applying human-centered design methods to renovate or expand their offerings.
        </p>
        <p>While
          enriched product and service portfolios benefit those who partake in the marketplace, innovations undertaken
          for
          innovationâ€™s sake have been seen to undermine some social and environmental conditions for the general public.
          We argue for a holistic view of responsible innovation that deals with the design, reification,
          and maintenance of positive, equitable, and meaningful futures desired by sustainable networks of human and
          non-human actors.

          This conceptual model of responsible innovation is organized around clusters of topics,
          theories, methodologies, and modes of design action. The model offers designers a systemic perspective on the
          often-overlooked implications of innovative offerings.
        </p>
        <p>The model acts as a scaffold for students to construct research paths across topics and methods,
          thereby
          empowering them to outline their learning experiences and develop sustainable solutions. The holistic model
          also
          serves as a pedagogical tool to help faculty engage the opportunities and challenges of responsible
          innovation.
